        <p>If you want to see a golden eagle, look up...way up! The majestic birds of prey soar high on wind currents as they migrate between their warmer winter homes and their summer nesting ranges. While they may appear as a tiny speck in the sky these are very large birds, with a wingspan that can reach over 7 feet across. Their agility and speed combined with extremely powerful talons make them one of the best predators in the sky.</p>
        <p>Like other raptors, the golden eagle has a sharp hooked beak for tearing meat, and powerful talons that are used to catch and carry prey. Golden eagles prefer hunting small mammals such as rabbits, ground squirrels, small foxes, or small deer but they will eat snakes and scavenge carrion (dead animals) if prey is scarce. Golden eagles will soar high above the ground, using their keen eyesight to spot potential food. Then, they swoop down and kill their prey with their talons. As they dive, it is estimated that golden eagles can reach speeds of 180 miles/hour or more!</p>
